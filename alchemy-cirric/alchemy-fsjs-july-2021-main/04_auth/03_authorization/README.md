# Authorization

While authentication determines whether a user is who they say they are, authorization determines what that user can access.
The process of authorization comes **after** we've authenticated a user.

Authorization is useful when you want to have more than one type user. There are a variety of ways to do authorization (permissions based, roles based, etc).
For instance, you could use authorization to have certain routes available to admin users but not customers.
