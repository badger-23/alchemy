# Arrays

## In Memory

In memory arrays are stored as a continuous block of memory addresses

## In Memory

<Box p={100}>

Because arrays are a continuous block of memory, when we create an array
our computers have to find a block of continuous memory large enough to
store our array.

In many other languages (like C/C++) this results in the developer having
to specify the maximum capacity of the array.

```cpp
string fruits[4] = {"apple", "banana", "pear", "grapes"};
```

## Dynamic Arrays

In JavaScript we have access to **dynamic** arrays. These are arrays who's
capacity automatically increases as needed.

## Dynamic Arrays

<Split>

<Box p={100}>

Typically, this is accomplished by:

1. Creating a new array with doubling the capacity
of the original array whenever the original capacity is exceeded.

1. Then each item in the original array is copied over to the new array.

1. Finally, the new item is added to the new array.
