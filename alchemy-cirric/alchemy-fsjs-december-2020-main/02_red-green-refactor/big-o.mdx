# Big O

## What is Big O?

<Box p={100}>

Big O is is used to classify how our algorithm's or program's run time
grows with the number of inputs.

```js title="For example" subtitle="this is a double function"
function double(arr) {
  return arr.map(n => n * 2);
}
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="in this function we are iterating over each item in an array"
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="for small arrays we only need to double a small about of numbers"
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="for large arrays we have to double a large amount of numbers"
```

```js title="For example" subtitle="here we have an array of 4 numbers"
function double(arr) {
  return arr.map(n => n * 2);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
double(numbers);
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="so we have to double 4 numbers"
```

```js title="For example" subtitle="if we had an array of 10 numbers"
function double(arr) {
  return arr.map(n => n * 2);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
double(numbers);
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="we would have to double 10 numbers"
```


```diff title="For example" subtitle="for each additional number in the array we have to do 1 more opperation"
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="this function is said to have linear time complexity since the time it takes grows linearly with the number of items in the array"
```

```diff title="For example" subtitle="linear time complexity is expressed as O(n) in big o notation"
```

* Constant Time O(1):  No matter how many items you have, the program always executes the same number of operations
* Logarithmic Time O(log n):  Binary search
* Linear Time O(n): For each item you have to execute an operation
* Polynomial Time O(n^2): Nested for loops
* Exponential Time O(2^n): You double the running time for each n
