# Redux Architecture

---

## Store

<Box p={200}>

The store is responsible for holding our applications state. You can think of it
as a global object accessible from anywhere in your application, like window.location.

</Box>

---

## Actions

<Box p={200}>

Actions are plain JavaScript objects that send data/events to your store. Actions
always have a type key which is the name of the event. Additionally, an action can
also have a payload.

```js
const myAction = {
  type: 'DO_STUFF'
}
```

</Box>

---


<Box p={200}>

## Reducers

Reducers are pure functions responsible for updating our state in response
to actions. Every action we dispatch will be sent to the reducer along with
the current state. The reducer is then responsible for handling the action
and returning a new state object based on the action.

```js
const initialState = {
  stuff: 'unfinished'
};

export default function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'DO_STUFF':
      return { stuff: 'done' };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

**NOTE** don't forget to provide a default case in case your reducer
cannot handle a particular action.

</Box>
