Min Max Binary Tree Height
---

## Challenge

What are the largest and smallest possible heights for a binary tree with `n` nodes?
- Consider the root node level "0" and first level of children a height of 1
- Don't worry about partially filled levels, we are looking at the overall characteristics

Express the `min` and `max` height in terms of `n`: 

- Find an expression that relates the number of nodes `n`, and the height `h`.
- Use algebra to isolate the height: `h = ?`

You may find it useful to know that:

`y = b^x` is Equivalent to `logb(y) = x`
